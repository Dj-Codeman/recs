# Rust Encryption Core System

Felt trendy at first now it's serious

RECS is aes-cbc-256 powered encryption library. It's purpose is to allow programs to store non-volatile data on the system
and not allow prying eyes to snoop and or modify this data. 

This is also a learning tool for me to better understand rust and working with unix-like systems.

## Getting started 

When using the recs it must be initialized by calling resc::initialize() before trying to read or write data 
This ensures all the maps( json file ) and the system array are in the right place and can be accessed

MORE documentation comming soon.
