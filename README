# Rust Encryption Core System

Felt trendy at first now it's serious

RECS is aes-cbc-256 powered encryption library. It's purpose is to allow programs to store non-volatile data on the system
and not allow prying eyes to snoop and or modify this data. 

This is also a learning tool for me to better understand rust and working with unix-like systems. I am no prefessional by anymeans
with that being said I personally use this code on my machines i'm not perfect so exersize care.

MORE documentation comming soon.
